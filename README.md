## What is computer graphics?
#### Computer Graphics is the use of computer to define, store, manipulate and present pictorial output. 

#### Typically, the term computer graphics refers to several different things:
<ul> 
  <li> The representation and manipulation of image data by a computer </li>
  <li> The various technologies used to create and manipulate images. </li>
  <li> The sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. </li>
</ul>

## How is Computer graphics different from Image processing and Computer vision?
#### Computer graphics is referred to the process of creating images from abstract models, whereas Image processing refers to the process of starting with an existing image and refining it in some way to obtain another image. Computer vision refers to the process of computing an abstract model given an input image. 

## Applications of Computer Graphics
<ul>
  <li> Plotting in business </li>
  <li> Scientific visualization </li> 
  <li> Web/ business/ commercial publishing and advertisements </li> 
  <li> Entertainment (movie, TV advertisement, Games etc.) </li> 
  <li> CAD/ CAM design (construction, circuits) </li> 
  <li> Multimedia </li>
  <li> Virtual reality </li> 
  <li> Cartography- Drawing maps </li>
  <li> Education and training- Flight simulators, sport simultors, etc. </li>
  <li> Medical Imaging- MRIs, CT Scan, X ray </li>
</ul>


## Rasterization and Scan conversion
#### Rasterization: The process of determining which pixels provide the best approximation to the desired line is known as rasterization. When combined with the process of generating the picture in scan line order is known as scan conversion.


## Four attributes of drawing in computer graphics are:
<ol>
  <li> Lines </li>
  <li> Arcs/curves/ellipses/circles </li>
  <li> Drawing text on the screen </li>
  <li> Polygon drawing and its filling </li>
</ol>


## Line Drawing Algorithms
### 1. Digital Difference/ Differential Analyzer (DDA)
#### Given the starting and ending coordinates of a line, DDA Algorithm attempts to generate the points between the starting and ending coordinates. It is the simplest line drawing algorithm.

### The advantages of DDA Algorithm are-
<ol>
  <li> It is a simple algorithm. </li>
  <li> It is easy to implement. </li>
  <li> It avoids using the multiplication operation which is costly in terms of time complexity. </li>
</ol>

### The disadvantages of DDA Algorithm are-
<ol>
  <li> The points generated by this algorithm are not accurate. </li>
  <li> Resulted lines are not smooth because of round off( ) function. </li>
  <li> Using round off( ) function increases time complexity of the algorithm. </li>
  <li> There is an extra overhead of using round off( ) function. </li>
</ol>
